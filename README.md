Task:
Suppose that the fourth generation mobile phone base stations in the Tampere area
operate as follows. The area is divided into squares. The squares form an SÃ—S matrix
with the rows and columns numbered from 0 to S-1. Each square contains a base
station. The number of active mobile phones inside a square can change because a
phone is moved from a square to another or a phone is switched on or off. At times,
each base station reports the change in the number of active phones to the main base
station along with the row and the column of the matrix.
Write a program, which receives these reports and answers queries about the current
total number of active mobile phones in any rectangle-shaped area.
But S size is < 10^9.
